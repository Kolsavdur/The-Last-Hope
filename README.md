# The Last Hope

DISCLAIMER: This mod will both need the latest versions of [MagmaLink](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink) and [Kolsavdur's Core Mod](https://github.com/Kolsavdur/Kolsavdur-Core-Mod) in order to work.

After over a year of working and countless setbacks, it is an absolute honour to bring you The Last Hope!
This mod will enable you to experience another version of Remy's good ending; one where you're still conscious and actively play a part between the negotiations between humanity and dragonkind.

To active this mod, you will need to:
-Keep Sebastian alive
-Complete two dates with Adine and have her in an impressed mood
-Complete two dates with Bryce and have him in an impressed mood
-Have Remy in an impressed mood after playing all four of his dates while being on his good route

This mod should automatically start during Reza's confrontation if the above requirements are met.

Okay, so, what's in this mod? Well...
-A monumental 100k+ script, rivaling the base game in content
-5 new endings, plus a variation of one ending
-A special route if you have completed The Last Dragon*
-An absolute ton of new music
-"Human literature"
-Sadness, again...
-And more!

*You need to complete one ending of The Last Dragon in version 1.1 or newer (the version that depends on the Kolsavdur Core Mod) for it to register.

I want to thank everybody that supported me through this journey, and to everyone eagerly waiting for the release of The Last Hope after working on it for so long. It had definitely been a rough one, but we made it in the end. Thanks, guys. <3

I tried my best to squash as many bugs and fix as many typos as I can, but with one person working on such a large mod, things are guaranteed to slip past. You have been warned. Also, this mod does support 4onen's Side Images mod. I highly recommend you play The Last Hope with Side Images enabled to have a better experience.

As usual, I hope you enjoy this mod as much as I had fun while making it!

That will be all.
